GAE-BOIL
============

This is a minimalistic boilerplate for simple Google App Engine applications. It's shipped with Twitter Bootstrap, some example templates, handlers, models and urls.

To run, navigate to the `src` folder and do `dev_appserver .`. Pages are rendered on `http://localhost:8080` and `http://localhost:8080/hello`.
